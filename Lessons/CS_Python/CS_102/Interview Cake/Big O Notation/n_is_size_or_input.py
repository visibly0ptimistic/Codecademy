# N could be the actual input, or the size of the input

def say_hi_n_times(n):
    for time in range(n):
        print("hi")


def print_all_items(items):
    for item in items:
        print(item)

# Both of these functions have O(n) runtime, even though one takes an integer as its input and the other takes a list:

# So sometimes n is an actual number that's an input to our function, and other times nn is the number of items in an input list (or an input map, or an input object, etc.).

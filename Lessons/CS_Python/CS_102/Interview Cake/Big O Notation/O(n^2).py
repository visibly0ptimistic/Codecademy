# this function runs in O(n^2) time (or "quadratic time"). If the list has 10 items, we have to print 100 times. If it has 1,000 items, we have to print 1,000,000 times.

# Here we're nesting two loops. If our list has n items, our outer loop runs n times and our inner loop runs n times for each iteration of the outer loop, giving us n^2 total prints.
